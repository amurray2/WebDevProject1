One of the cool things I learned while working on this assignment was how to pass a function as a parameter. I didnâ€™t quite understand how the ajax function was working but after reviewing the code I think I got it. We send two parameters to the ajax function, the first being the url and the second is a function with a parameter. The second parameter we pass to the ajax function is now called successCallback. We load all the data from the url and then at the end of the ajax function, if successCallback is of type function which it should always be it will call itself and pass the data we just loaded in the ajax function. The successCallback function is the arrow function we passed (second parameter) and it will execute its commands. Sorry that is a bit confusing but I wanted to write it down so I could make sure I understood it properly. I am still a little confused on how callback() works.
